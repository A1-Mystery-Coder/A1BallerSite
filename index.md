## What is the baller installer for A1Up Pinball machines?
It allows the downloading and installation of updates to your Arcade1up pinball machine without the need for overwriting the entire emmc potentially degrading the performance of your hardware, it also preserves your high scores in the process.

Their method will overwrite the entire emmc performing several write executions potentially degrading performance of your PCB over time, our method will only ovewrite the single file you're updating meaning our method is safer and more reliable for the longevity of your hardware.

We do not condone piracy, as such you shouldn't install tables you do not own onto your Arcade1up cabinet, this is simply a tool allowing you to do the upgrade method without having to lose your high-scores.
