## Welcome to the A1UP Baller Installer Website

Here you'll find links to the latest version as well as instructions on how to use the tool.

There's none of that here yet though...


## What is the baller installer for A1Up Pinball machines?
It allows the downloading and installation of updates to your Arcade1up pinball machine without the need for overwriting the entire emmc potentially degrading the performance of your hardware, it also preserves your high scores in the process.

Their method will overwrite the entire emmc performing several write executions potentially degrading performance of your PCB over time, our method will only ovewrite the single file you're updating meaning our method is safer and more reliable for the longevity of your hardware.

We do not condone piracy, as such you shouldn't install tables you do not own onto your Arcade1up cabinet, this is simply a tool allowing you to do the upgrade method without having to lose your high-scores.

Additionally because of the way we do things, we're also able to support OSX where Arcade1up currently does not; meaning we fill a gap they're unable to by allowing those who own Mac computers to still update their cabinets and make those Attack From Mars cabinets playable again where they previously were not and people aren't getting what they've paid for. Additionally, those with Macs who had contacted Arcade1up were simply told that they don't have any plans to support them in the future.

In otherwords, Arcade1up provided you with a broken product; released an update you couldn't use and then told you if you don't have a PC you're on your own sorry.
